'''
Input: 
Input contains one string ùëÜ which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, punctuation
marks and brackets from the set []{}().

Output: 
If the code in ùëÜ uses brackets correctly, output ‚ÄúSuccess" (without the quotes). Otherwise,
output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket (right), and if there are no unmatched closing
brackets (left), output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.
